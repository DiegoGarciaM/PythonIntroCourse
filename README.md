Course Title: Python Programming for Beginners

Course Overview:

    This course is designed to introduce beginners to the fundamentals of Python programming.
    Participants will learn Python syntax, data structures, and basic problem-solving skills.

Prerequisites:

    No prior programming experience required.

Course Outline:

Module 1: Introduction to Python

    Lesson 1: Getting Started with Python

    Introduction to Python and its applications.
    Setting up the Python development environment.
    Your first Python program.
    Example: Create a program that greets the user and asks for their name.

    Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types

    Understanding variables and data types (int, float, string, bool).
    Variable assignment and naming conventions.
    Basic input and output.
    Example: Build a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

Module 2: Control Flow and Logic

    Lesson 3: Conditional Statements

    If statements and conditional logic.
    Using comparison operators.
    Nested conditions.
    Example: Write a program that determines if a given number is even or odd.

    Lesson 4: Loops and Iteration

    For loops and while loops.
    Loop control statements (break and continue).
    Practical loop examples.
    Example: Create a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit.

Module 3: Data Structures

    Lesson 5: Lists and Tuples

    Introduction to lists and tuples.
    Accessing and modifying elements.
    Common list operations.
    Example: Build a to-do list manager that allows users to add, remove, and view tasks.

    Lesson 6: Dictionaries and Sets

    Understanding dictionaries and sets.
    Dictionary operations.
    Set operations.
    Example: Develop a dictionary-based English-to-Spanish translator.

Module 4: Functions and Modular Programming

    Lesson 7: Functions

    Defining and calling functions.
    Parameters and return values.
    Scope and lifetime of variables.
    Example: Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.

    Lesson 8: Modules and Libraries

    Importing and using modules.
    Creating custom modules.
    Exploring Python's standard library.
    Example: Build a simple text-based game using modules for randomness and user input.

Module 5: File Handling

    Lesson 9: Reading and Writing Files

    Opening, reading, and writing to files.
    Handling exceptions with file operations.
    Best practices for file handling.
    Example: Develop a program that reads a CSV file, processes data, and generates a report.

Module 6: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

    Lesson 10: Classes and Objects

    Understanding classes and objects.
    Defining attributes and methods.
    Creating and using objects.
    Example: Build a class to model a simple bank account with deposit and withdrawal methods.

    Lesson 11: Inheritance and Polymorphism

    Inheritance and base classes.
    Polymorphism and method overriding.
    Building a simple OOP program.
    Example: Create a hierarchy of geometric shapes using inheritance and calculate their areas.

Module 7: Introduction to Error Handling

    Lesson 12: Exception Handling

    Handling errors with try...except blocks.
    Raising and handling custom exceptions.
    Debugging techniques.
    Example: Write a program that handles different types of exceptions, such as division by zero or file not found errors.

Module 8: Final Projects and Advanced Topics (Optional)

    Lesson 13: Mini Projects

    Guided mini projects to apply knowledge.
    Enhance problem-solving skills.
    Example: Develop a simple text-based game, like Hangman or Tic-Tac-Toe.

    Lesson 14: Advanced Topics (optional)

    Introduction to GUI programming with tkinter.
    Working with external libraries.
    Introduction to web development with Python.
    Example: Create a basic tkinter application, like a calculator with a graphical user interface.
